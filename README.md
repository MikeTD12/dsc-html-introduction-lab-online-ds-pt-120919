## The In-Browser IDE
</head>
<body>
<p>If you're viewing this lesson on learn, towards the top of this page you'll see a button that says "Open IDE" (it's just to the left of the GitHub and Raise Issue icons). This will allow you to have a terminal and text editor emulated in your browser! With that, you won't even have to open up another program.</p>

Once you click it, your browser should look something like this:


<p><a href(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-html-introduction-lab/master/images/open_ide1.png)</p>

If the button doesn't appear to work for you (it opens up blank), go [here](https://learn.co/account/environment) and set your learning environment to "IDE in browser".

<p>When you run your tests, just type `learn` into the bottom of the three boxes which is a terminal for you to use with the in-browser IDE. Once your tests are passing, type `learn submit` there to tell us that you're done!</p>


## Instructions

Open `index.html` in your text editor (or the in-browser IDE). Add a `doctype` tag at the top of the
file indicating that the rest of the file will be HTML code. Then create the opening and closing `HTML` tags to enclose the remainder of your page's
content. Add opening and closing `head` and `body` tags within the outer
`HTML` tags to break your HTML document up into two sections. Remember, the
`head` section generally contains data intended for the web browser, and the
`body` section contains the content our users will see and interact with on the
page.

Finally, add a couple of sections so the web page isn't blank. Add a `title` such as "This is the title" within the `head`. Add a `p` (paragraph) with the `head` such as "This is a body paragraph".

## Viewing your work in the browser

While working through these assignments, your general workflow should center on
writing code in the text editor and observing the subsequent impact on the displayed webpage in another tab of your browser.

If you're using a local development environment, you can open the HTML file directly in your browser. If you're coding in the
Learn IDE, you can simply type `"httpserver"` in the bottom terminal emulator of the Learn IDE.

For further details, check out this [Help Center article](http://help.learn.co/the-learn-ide/common-ide-questions/viewing-html-pages-in-the-learn-ide) that explains how to spin up and connect to a simple remote server.

Once you have the HTML document open in your browser, you can make changes to
it in the text editor, save the file, refresh the page in the browser, and see
the changes instantly.
